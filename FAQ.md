### How to make a sell/short order when running a `Strategy` ? ###
You can determine the kind of order in the `TimeSeriesManager#run` method with help of the `OrderType` parameter:

```java
/**
 * Runs the provided strategy over the managed series.
 * <p>
 * Opens the trades with the specified {@link OrderType orderType} order.
 * @param strategy the trading strategy
 * @param orderType the {@link OrderType} used to open the trades
 * @return the trading record coming from the run
 */
public TradingRecord run(Strategy strategy, OrderType orderType) {
    return run(strategy, orderType, NaN);
}
```
The standard value for this mehtod is `OrderType.BUY`. That means entry signals generated by your `Strategy` will create a buying order and every exit signal will create a complementary (in this case `OrderType.SELL`) order. If you change this parameter to `OrderType.SELL`, the `TimeSeriesManager` will create **selling** orders for entry signals and **buying** orders for exit signals.
* **Note:** At the moment it is only possible to run a `Strategy` with [long](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long.asp) (buy-sell) **or** with [short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/short.asp) (sell-buy) trades. There is no possibility to mix short and long trades in one and the same run done by the `TimeSeriesManager`.

### What does `Num` or `Function<Number, Num>`?
With help of the `Num` interface and a `Function<Number, Num>` ta4j enables the use of different data types like `Double` or `BigDecimal` for storage and calculations. For further information take a look at the [Num article](Num.html).

### Why does my `Indicator` not match someone else's values? ##

If you are using an `Indicator` that uses an exponential moving average (EMA) such as `EMAIndicator` or `RSIIndicator` then you will have to understand data length dependence and convergence.  The short answer is that you need to "seed" your `Indicator` with several hundred `Bars` of data prior to the indices for which you seek the values or those values will have relatively large error.

Since EMA's use the prior value in their calculation, the values depend on how many prior values you have.  Related, there is some question as to how to initialize the first value of an EMA.  The first problem is generally solved by including at least 200 `Bars` of `TimeSeries` data prior to the indices for which you are interested.  The second problem is currently solved by setting the first EMA value to the first data value:
```
@Override
protected Num calculate(int index) {
    if (index == 0) {
        return indicator.getValue(0);
    }
```
If a different solution to initialization is required, then the `EMAIndicator` may be extended to a subclass with a different solution to `if (index == 0)`.
