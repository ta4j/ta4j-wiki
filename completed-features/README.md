## Purpose

These documents serve as:
- Historical reference for design decisions
- Documentation of implementation approaches
- Context for future maintainers
- Examples of the design process

## Contents

- **[RELEASE_PROCESS_PRD.md](RELEASE_PROCESS_PRD.md)** - Automated Release Process PRD documenting the two-phase release workflow implementation (completed 2026-01-16)
- **[PRD-Charting-Refactor-Checklist.md](PRD-Charting-Refactor-Checklist.md)** - Charting refactor checklist and implementation status (completed 2026-01-31)

When a feature PRD is completed and implemented:

3. Add an "Implementation Status" section documenting what was delivered
4. Resolve or document any open questions
5. Add references to related documentation
