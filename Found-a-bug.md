# Found a Bug?
We are sorry about this. Anyway we are willing to keep the codebase free of bugs. For this we need your help!
Please share us following details in a bug report:

* what exactly have you used? (Which indicator, oscillator, ...)
* what financial instrument (stock, ...) have you used?
* what timeframe have you used for the analysis?
* what interval (5min, 15min, 1h, ...) have you used for the analysis?
* against what tool (Metatrader4, ...) do you compare to identify the bug?

Great would be if you could attach us a unit-test of your code for a in depth analysis. Which we also can take over for getting better quality into the lib. How to do this can be found here [How to contribute](How-to-contribute.md)
